The __hiker__ package aids in the modeling of specifically human movement across a landscape. Much of its code was inspired by Jacob van Etten's (2017) [`gdistance`](https://github.com/AgrDataSci/gdistance) package, though it works with more modern spatial tools, specifically [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and [`terra`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html). 

Note: `terra` is currently facing some issues with its underlying Rcpp that throw seemingly random warnings and errors (see, eg., [#30](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/30)). For example, you might see:  

```r 
Error in x$.self$finalize() : attempt to apply non-function 
```

Evidently, you can ignore these errors, though it's still frustrating, and users of hiker will just have to live with it until it gets sorted out.  


## Installation

The hiker package is not currently on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), though that will hopefully change soon enough. In the meantime, you can download and install the development version using:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kbvernon/hiker")
```


## Example

Consider the [Red Butte Canyon Research Natural Area](https://redbuttecanyon.net/) in the Wasatch Foothills above the University of Utah. If I wanted to hike up this canyon in the shortest time possible, what route should I take?

```{r example}

library(hiker)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(viridis)

```

```{r}

fn <- system.file("extdata/red_butte_dem.tif", package = "hiker")
red_butte_dem <- rast(fn)

from <- st_sf(geometry = st_sfc(st_point(c(432000, 4513100)),
                                crs = 26912))

to <- st_sf(geometry = st_sfc(st_point(c(436750, 4518500)),
                              crs = 26912))

```

To figure out the "shortest" path from start to end, we need to have some sense of the time it would take to move through any particular location in the canyon. This _cost surface_ is the terrain we are hiking in R. 

```{r cost_surface, fig.width = 350/72}

(terrain <- hf_terrain(red_butte_dem))

# to adjust legend (plg) and axis (pax) text size
pax <- list(cex.axis = 0.65)
plg <- list(cex = 0.65)

plot(hf_rasterize(terrain), 
     col = viridis(50), 
     pax = pax, 
     plg = plg)

title(main = "Travel Cost (sec)", adj = 0, line = 0.3)

```

The next step is to simply pass the start and end point, along with the cost surface, to one of our three path functions. For instance, `hf_hike()` computes shortest paths and returns them as `sf` objects.

```{r}

short_path <- hf_hike(terrain, from, to)

short_path

```

Now we can visualize this `short_path`. 

```{r short_path_plot, fig.width = 350/72}

plot(red_butte_dem, 
     col = viridis(50),
     pax = pax, 
     plg = plg)

title(main = "Path over Elevation (m)", adj = 0, line = 0.3)

plot(st_geometry(short_path),
     col = "white",
     lwd = 1.5,
     add = TRUE)

plot(st_geometry(from), 
     pch = 21, 
     cex = 1.3, 
     bg = "red2", 
     col = "white", 
     add = TRUE)

plot(st_geometry(to), 
     pch = 21, 
     cex = 1.3, 
     bg = "dodgerblue3", 
     col = "white", 
     add = TRUE)

```



## Alternative packages

I am aware of three packages that offer similar functionality: 

* [`leastcostpath`](https://github.com/josephlewis/leastcostpath),
* [`movecost`](https://github.com/cran/movecost), and
* [`marmap`](https://github.com/ericpante/marmap)

The hiker package differs from these packages in the following ways:

1. hiker is simple. The package is somewhat singular in purpose and many arguably reasonable assumptions come baked in. This makes for much simpler code and a more user-friendly API.    
2. hiker is tidy (or tries to be). As much as possible, code is written to comport with the `tidyverse` [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), mostly thanks to `usethis::use_tidy_style()`, and development largely follows the guidelines described in Wickham and Bryan's [_R Packages_](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html).  
2. hiker uses [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) rather than its predecessor sp.  
2. hiker uses [`terra`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html) instead of its predecessor `raster`.
