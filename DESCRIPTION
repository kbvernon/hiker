Title: Model Hiking Paths Over Costly Terrains
Description: The hiker package provides a suite of functions to model least-cost
    distances between points, least-cost paths between points, and accumulated 
    travel time from any point to any location across a landscape. To estimate 
    the cost of traversing a terrain, hiker implements a few well-known hiking 
    functions, including Tobler and Campbell.
